C++ course for the Arduino
==========================

C++ is an excellent language for real time control applications.
It allows for clean program structure and is just as efficient and close to the metal as C.
Discover how concepts like encapsulation and polymorphism allow you to enhance your designs,
while the generated code becomes more compact than ever before.

**Many C++ courses are about writing GUI-oriented software, meant to be run on a PC.
This one's about writing fast, flexible Arduino applications with a tiny memory footprint.**

Cantino comes with a microscopic library that allows the use *main*, *cin* en *cout* in the familiar Arduino Genuino IDE.
To keep Cantino accessible to anyone, an absolute minimum of peripheral hardware is used in the examples.

Cantino doesn't assume any previous programming knowledge and can be used as a first time course in any curriculum.
To complete it successfully you only need two things: curiosity and persistence.
You'll be a C++ programmer after that, so let's get started...
